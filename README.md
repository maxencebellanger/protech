# Protech
Protech' stands for *Projet Technique*. It is a project during the first semester of the second year at Mines Saint-Etienne. <br>

In this project we have to create a driver for a DAC which isn't supported on Linux. 

The code will be written in Python and will mainly use the following packages: <br>
*pyusb*
*pySerial*

All of the packages needed are in the *requirements.txt* file which can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
